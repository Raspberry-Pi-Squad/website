					<h1>The Best Pi Server</h1>
					<p>
						I love this server as it isn't really really big because I don't really like it when a server is constantly pinging but this one is perfect! I joined when it had 25 people and when this review was made it had 51 I am still on the server and still will be.

					<h1>Awesome</h1>
					<p>
						Really nice staff, awesome server structure, and amazing hangout. I'd recommend this server to anyone who likes to hang out with friends, or just likes coding in Raspberry Pi!</p>
